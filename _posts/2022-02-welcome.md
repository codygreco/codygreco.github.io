The number of students who change their major away from computer science is a large issue for universities globally. Computer science maintains the highest drop rate of all majors at a startling 10%. This difficulty can be attributed to numerous factors including (but not limited to): culture and stereotype threat, difficulty of programming, math prerequisites, and intrinsic motivation. I propose a consolidated “bootcamp” which helps high school and college students prepare for the rigors of pursuing a degree in CS. The course will help students who need it by providing mentorship and guidance with an aim to bolster their CS fundamentals and increase their resilience.
