### Course Technology
Jupyter notebooks are a simple and intuitive way of learning programming due to the wide availability of cloud hosted notebook solutions, large array of kernel support, and ease of editing. Additionally, notebooks can be viewed and edited easily through github. Students will be able to fork a base repository that will prompt them to complete tasks and they will be able to commit their changes back to their own repository.

### Student takeaways
One large issue with computer science is that students may not see how it applies to them and why they should be interested in the subject. As such, when the course work gets difficult students tend to drop the major. The goal of this course is multifaceted but can be grouped into categories.

-	Teach version control through the utilization of Github.  
-	To teach basic fundamentals of programming and to give exposure to data types and data structures
-	To teach data analysis through the pandas api
-	Most importantly to try to provide motivation and  and increase resilience
